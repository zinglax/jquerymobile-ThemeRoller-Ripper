GOT THE RIPPER IN



#### OLD

from here down

a library where ripping out Hex Colors with Templeting Languages is cool and Replacing it with Useful Stuff is awesome! 

Author Note:
The key to all of this will be the uniqueness of the color.  Once having this list of colors (once filled out) in the json, we will be able to iterate through (multithreaded) and replace all files in the colorgen JQMT.  Each iteration, within branch/tree will be able to rip a new place for jinja templating tags. Hint: We will be using jinja on each iteration set up with a new set of start_ and end_ strings for block, variable, and comment.
